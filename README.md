# Conrad Adventskalender
Python scripts I implemented for my Conrad Advent calendar :)

## Requirements
### Hardware
I use a RaspberryPi 3 for this project.
Other models should work fine but you must check for correct wiring.  
Display, keyboard, mouse, and an audio device are indispensable.

### Software
- [Raspbian Stretch](https://www.raspbian.org/)
- Python 3
- Scratch 1.4
- GPIO Zero 1.4.0
    * `sudo apt install python3-gpiozero` or
    * `pip install gpiozero`
- Raspberry Pi GPIO 0.6.3
    * `sudo apt install python-rpi.gpio` or
    * `pip install RPi.GPIO`

## Conclusion

This Advent calendar was somewhat disappointing.  
Most of the gifts were simple jumper cables or pin headers and there are quite some mistakes in the manual.  
Without some kind of mount for the servo motor each task with it was very annoying.  
Some resources are only with a prior registration available.  

It's probably a fun project for children or novice users but not for an experienced tinkerer.
