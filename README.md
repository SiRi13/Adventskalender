# Adventskalender
Python scripts I implemented for my Conrad Advent calendar :)

---
## Requirements
### Hardware
I use a RaspberryPi 3 for this project. 
Other models should work fine but you must check for correct wiring.

### Software
- Raspbian Stretch
- Python 3
- GPIO Zero 1.4.0
    * Install with `sudo apt install python3-gpiozero` or
    * `pip install gpiozero`
