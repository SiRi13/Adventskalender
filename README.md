# Adventskalender
Python scripts I implemented for my Conrad Advent calendar :)

## Day 1
### Contents
<img src="day1/assets/IMG_20171202_090406.jpg" alt="Contents of Day 1" style="width: 260px; transform: rotate(-90deg); margin-left: 45px; margin-top: -35px; margin-bottom: -35px"/>

Amount | Name | Note
-----| ---- | ----
1 | Red LED | with built-in resistor
2 | Jumper Wire | Black and red

### Task
First day was a simple circuit of one LED directly connected to the Raspberry PI, thanks to the built-in resistor.
The Python script toggles the LED at a rate of 0.5 Hz on and off.

### Results
